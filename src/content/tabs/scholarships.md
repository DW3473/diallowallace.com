Mr. Richard Veri was a cherished presence in my life. Through the time I spent with him, I learned what it truly means to be a scientist, a teacher, and a human being. Many of the victories I have achieved began with his patient willingness to answer my questions about science and engineering. To carry forward his spirit of curiosity and dedication to knowledge, a scholarship in Richard’s name has been established to enable an educator to attend Space Camp.

Jim Irwin, one of the astronauts who walked on the Moon, befriended me during my senior year of high school. I remain deeply grateful for his guidance and mentorship. During Apollo 15, he and Commander Dave Scott discovered the celebrated “Genesis Rock,” a lunar sample that provided vital clues about the Moon’s ancient origins and reinforced scientific theories linking its formation to the early Earth. In honor of Jim and his family’s sacrifice for our nation, a scholarship in his name has been established to support a student’s opportunity to attend Space Camp.
